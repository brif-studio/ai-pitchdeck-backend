Our startup's email address is ertugrultunc38@gmail.com, phone number is 05432308084.\nOur 1. problem is that people cannot find a team, job, freelancer job they feel they belong to, either paid or unpaid.\nOur second problem is that the teams and people who want to develop their own business do not have anyone to help them in the job position they are looking for. So if you don't have money, you can't find people to trade your workforce.\nOur third problem is that the exchanged workforce does not have the ground to cooperate later in a suitable and reliable environment. In other words, there is no precaution against fraudsters who will exploit the workforce.\nThe solution is very simple, first of all, create a safe environment where people can safely share their workforce and not exploit each other's rights. Then, designing and adjusting the system according to each business category, and finally, making each other's work and doing the work they want with their own field of expertise and making them use the labor exchange instead of money. We call this swap a match.\nOur difference is that we do not force people to financially when they want to develop a business. If you are a resourceful and intelligent person, you can buy a job by giving money with what you can do. Here, both sides proceed in line with their own interests. For example, if a plumber wants to build a website for himself, he does the plumbing in response to the plumbing needs of a software developer and gets a website in return. We bring those in need together with the workforce, not money.\nOur technology is our algorithm. In the face of an algorithm that develops and learns as a result of determining who needs what and who needs what and who is doing what with the information obtained in advance, we always direct whoever needs what to the needs of the appropriate people or inform them through the notification method.\nWe bring together people who do not want to spend a lot of money, but who want to grow by working constantly.\nWe want to ensure that we remain partners or brokers in these paid business plans by always being in favor of cooperation in our market plan and growth target, by ensuring that people who have done business together continue in their workforce and do new jobs, and by having paid business plans set up.\nOur first office was opened in the first quarter of 2023 and we want to make our first investment in the second quarter of 2023 and upgrade the mvp version to pro in the third quarter of 2023."

Focus on the features, then add the benefits to explain why these features are worth investing in.\n \nIt's also a good idea to explain why the timing is ideal for launching your product or company. Dropbox does this well by highlighting trends related to its target audiences, such as the increased use of digital devices and more distributed/remote working teams.\nWhat would be the if Dropbox had answered the analysis questions?\nQuestion 1: Who are you?\nName: Drew Houston (CEO)\nProject / Startup Name: Dropbox\nContact details: linkedin.com/in/drewhouston\n\nQuestion 2: What is the problem?\nTop 3 problems:\n1.

Then, instead of talking about the solution, they show it in their app.\nThe next few slides dive deep into the app's functionality - how it works and the value it provides. Using step-by-step screenshots, they drop their conversation into their apps.\nFinally, the investor presentation outlines, in two short slides, additional features in development and the revenue opportunity or how they plan to monetize. \nKEY INFERENCE: Using storytelling to explain a problem can make it more relatable and easier to understand. A good pitching platform puts investors in the customers' shoes, which naturally makes them more curious to learn about the solution.\nAnother lesson to be learned here is to use the functionality of your product to explain the solution. Tinder does a great job of telling users how to navigate the app with step-by-step screenshots to meet their needs.\nWhat would be the if Tinder had answered the analysis questions?\nQuestion 1: Who are you?\nMy name is Sean Rad and I am the founder of Match Box. You can reach me at Seanrad@tinder.com.\nQuestion 2: What is the problem?\nThe top 3 problems that our potential customers have are:\n1. Fear of rejection when approaching someone they are interested in.\n2. Difficulty finding people with similar interests and social circles.\n3. Limited options for meeting new people, especially in specific locations.\nQuestion 3: What is your solution?\nOur solution consists of the following features that will solve these problems:\n1. Hyper-location: Using WIFI, not GPS, we provide users with matches who are located near them.\n2. Mutual liking: Users only connect with each other if there is a mutual interest.\n3. Social interests and friends in common: We take into account users' social connections and interests to provide more relevant matches.\nQuestion 4: What is the value proposition?\nOur solution offers a unique and innovative way for individuals to overcome their fear of rejection and easily connect with potential matches. We enhance the dating experience by providing a platform that is based on users' shared interests and social connections.\nQuestion 5: What is the underlying magic?\nThe technology behind Match Box includes hyper-location tracking using WIFI, which allows us to provide matches that are nearby. Additionally, our algorithm considers mutual liking, social interests, and friends in common, creating an experience that cannot be easily replicated.\nQuestion 6: Who are the target customers?\nOur target customers are individuals who are actively looking for romantic connections. They are tech-savvy and open to using dating apps to meet new people.\nQuestion 7: Explain the go-to-market plan.\nOur go-to-market plan involves targeting early adopters who are likely to embrace new dating technologies. We will use marketing strategies, such as social media campaigns, advertising, and partnerships with influencers, to reach our target audience. We will also focus on building a strong user base in specific locations before expanding globally. \nQuestion 8: What are the cost metrics?\nKey costs include hardware and software development, customer acquisition costs (CAC), distribution costs, hosting fees, and costs related to maintaining the service. Additionally, people costs for maintaining the platform and providing customer support are also considered.\nQuestion 9: What are the revenue metrics?\nKey revenue metrics include the number of users who make in-app purchases, such as paying to see new matches or sending virtual flirt gifts. We also track the revenue generated from advertising partnerships and additional premium features that users can opt for. \nQuestion 10: What is the time plan?\nCurrently, Match Box is in the development stage. Our next steps involve beta testing with a select group of users and refining the app based on their feedback.

Airbnb's investor presentation is a prime example of simplicity.\nWhat would be the if AirBnB had answered the analysis questions?\nQuestion 1: Who are you?\nI am name, the founder of AirBed&Breakfast. You can reach me at example@gmail.\nQuestion 2: What is the problem?\nThe top 3 problems that our potential customers have are:\n- Price is an important concern for customers booking travel online.\n- Hotels leave travelers disconnected from the city and its culture.\n- There is no easy way to book a home with a local or become a host. \nQuestion 3: What is your solution?\nOur solution is a web platform where users can rent out their space to host travelers, allowing them to save money when traveling, make money when hosting, and have a local connection to the city.\nQuestion 4: What is your value proposition?\nOur value proposition is to change the way people travel by offering affordable accommodations that provide a unique and authentic experience. We enhance the travel experience by connecting travelers with local hosts and allowing them to immerse themselves in the culture of the city they are visiting.\nQuestion 5: What is the underlying magic?\nThe underlying magic behind AirBed&Breakfast is our technology platform, which provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for both hosts and travelers. Our algorithms match hosts and travelers based on their preferences and requirements, ensuring a successful and enjoyable stay. This technology advantage makes it difficult for competitors to replicate our platform.\nQuestion 6: Who are your target customers?\nOur target customers are travelers who are looking for affordable and unique accommodations, as well as hosts who want to make extra income by renting out their space. We cater to a wide range of customers, from budget-conscious travelers to those seeking a more authentic and local experience.\nQuestion 7: Explain your go-to-market plan.\nWe will reach customers through a combination of marketing and distribution channels. Our strategy includes targeting events and partnerships with travel-related companies to increase our visibility and attract early adopters. We will also leverage platforms like Craigslist to reach a larger audience and provide a dual posting feature for easy listing.\nQuestion 8: What are your cost metrics?\nOur key costs include hardware and software infrastructure, customer acquisition costs (CAC), distribution costs, hosting, and personnel. We have a detailed cost analysis that takes into account both fixed and variable costs to ensure a sustainable business model.\nQuestion 9: What are your revenue metrics?\nOur revenue metrics include the number of customers we can reach, the number of sales we can make, the average fee per booking, and the customer lifetime value (CLTV). By tapping into the 10.6 million trips with AirBed&Breakfast, we can generate substantial revenue and capture a significant market share.\nQuestion 10: What is the time plan?\nCurrently, AirBed&Breakfast is already operational and has gained market validation with over 630,000 listings on temporary housing site Couchsurfing.com and 17,000 listings on SF & NYC Craigslist from 07/09 - 07/16. Our next steps include expanding our market adoption through targeted events and partnerships, as well as improving our platform based on user feedback and market demands.\n<Necessary information ends>\n\n<INSTRUCTION starts>\nFirst of all the pitch deck should be 10 slides. Use all of the given details, instructions, methods, notes, information and pieces of knowledge you know to think and questions to understand the businesses of the company. You can use details, examples and data that are not mentioned but go out of context. Check back after you've finished the presentation and make it the best it can be. Don't forget to mention the presenter and the title and contact details. Think of pictures and visuals that could be included or beautify and support the presentation. for example, a Tinder had used a photo of a young man. In fact, let's say that a problem related to carrying apples is solved, a picture of a truck carrying apples can be posted. You must show the images with <insert image description> at the end of each slide.\nAs you can see from the examples on the first slide, things such as the brand's name, certain, and the slogan, addition, are generally preferred. \nThe second and third slides usually show the problem first and then the solution.\nWhile giving the problem and the solution, the context was taken into consideration and not broken. You don't have to use the given problem titles directly. but in some places the problem is given directly and in some places it is narrated by storytelling. \nYou can consider the seriousness and emotional state of the company when deciding on this for example; if you saw an emotional topic like Tinder, there is a `love` factor, in writing a story, giving examples sarcastically (if its fun) will allow viewers to empathize and see through the eyes of the target costumers. Or you saw another emotional topic like global warming giving examples or telling a sad story, a word from a famous person might be good. on the other hand, if there is real data but didn't mention you can use it, give solid examples, statistics or a reference to a scientific book. do not forget to highlight the important points, you should introduce the company to the audience in the best way, while doing this, do not write very long articles, be short and concise.\nIn the general structure of the presentation; Don't forget to mention the titles and contents of the value proposition, underlying magic, target customers, go-to-market plan, cost metrics, revenue metrics and time plan. You can evaluate slides 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 for them, respectively.\nFinally, there MUST be an image indicator at the end of each slide. If you have a picture that you think would be appropriate, write it as <description of the picture> at the end of the slide. The image must be object-based for example a person, people, trees-nature or any living things; it can be a building, a city, a vehicle or traffic, etc. Be careful not to use abstract expressions\n\nyou can only use this format:\n<YOUR OUTPUT FORMAT>\n[\n{\n\"text\":”<insert what you want to write on slide one>\",\n\"image\":\"<insert your describing for the image that you want to put on slide one>\"\n},\n{\n\"text\":”<insert what you want to write on slide two>\",\n\"image\":\"<insert your describing for the image that you want to put on slide two>\"\n},\n(write down each slide until slide ten. write your text in part. you can get a new sentence in a single input)\n{\n\"text\":”<insert what you want to write on slide ten>\",\n\"image\":\"<insert your describing for the image that you want to put on slide ten>\"\n},\n]\n<YOUR OUTPUT FORMAT>\nyou can't say any assistant words like; Sure! or Please review the presentation etc.\nContinue from the first slide to the tenth slide and check for the last time for any missing or mistakes. DO NOT FORGET THE IMAGE PART. And also a little tip for you: using storytelling might be better sometimes. becareful about data leaking, if you saw something you are not familiar return null\n<INSTRUCTION ends>\n\n\n\n"

If you are a resourceful and intelligent person, you can buy a job by giving money with what you can do. Here, both sides proceed in line with their own interests. For example, if a plumber wants to build a website for himself, he does the plumbing in response to the plumbing needs of a software developer and gets a website in return. We bring those in need together with the workforce, not money.\nOur technology is our algorithm. In the face of an algorithm that develops and learns as a result of determining who needs what and who needs what and who is doing what with the information obtained in advance, we always direct whoever needs what to the needs of the appropriate people or inform them through the notification method.\nWe bring together people who do not want to spend a lot of money, but who want to grow by working constantly.\nWe want to ensure that we remain partners or brokers in these paid business plans by always being in favor of cooperation in our market plan and growth target, by ensuring that people who have done business together continue in their workforce and do new jobs, and by having paid business plans set up.\nOur first office was opened in the first quarter of 2023 and we want to make our first investment in the second quarter of 2023 and upgrade the mvp version to pro in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nhere is the detils you can use:\n- Industry: Freelancing/Job marketplace\n- Sector: Workforce management/Job matching\n- Vision: To create a safe and reliable platform for people to exchange their skills and services without relying on traditional monetary transactions\n- Mission: Assist individuals and teams in finding a suitable workforce or job position, fostering cooperation and growth opportunities\n- Presentation language style: Informative, practical, and focused on the benefits of a non-monetary labor exchange system and a little bit of fun cause of human relations.\n- Target customers: Individuals and teams looking for a job or workforce, particularly those who want to develop their own business or trade their skills\n- Target presentation viewers: Investors, potential partners or clients who are interested in supporting innovative labor exchange platforms"

You will find pieces of information below about prompting and Dall-e. There will be style details and prompting tips. You should follow the given details, pieces of information and instructions. \n<Preview of prompting and Dall-E>\nDALL·E 2 is a game-changing new tool for AI-powered art creation, turning sentences into beautiful pictures in seconds. Like magic.\nA prompt is a sentence, 400 characters or less, that describes the image you want.\n\nHere are some random examples:\n•full body photo of a horse in a space suit.\n•A Charming Hedge Maze Dotted By Rose •Bushes And Intricately Designed Lampposts, Digital Art, Trending On Artstation.\n•A Grey Kitten Standing On A Pizza In Outer Space. The Kitten Is Eating A Piece Of Pizza. Pizza Slices Flying With Angel Wings In Background, Dark Cyan Galaxy And Stars In Background, 4K Photoshopped Image, Look At That Detail.\n•A Portrait Of A Dog In A Library, Sigma 85Mm F/1.4\n•An Oil Painting Of A Young Boy With Long Blonde Hair\nSleeping In Bed With A Checkered Comforter\n•A Male American High School Student Reading A Newspaper, In Chinese Watercolor, Award-Winning Painting\n•A 3D Render Of A Teapot In The Shape Of A King With Red Hair, Realistic, Artstation, Cg\n•Jackson Pollock, Air Jordan sneakers, digital art, product photography\n\nPrompts can be very long or very short!\nPrompt: grainy abstract experimental expired film photo of a woman in red dress, talking angrily on mobile phone, gesticulating angrily, in 1960s New York City by Saul Leiter, 50mm lens, cinematic colors, oversaturated filter, blur, reflection, refraction, distortion, rain drops, smears, smudges, blur, cinestill 800t\nPrompt: 🌈🚀🤩, octane 3D render\n\nDALL·E has not explicitly been 'taught' anything, like who Frida Kahlo is, or what a llama looks like, or what a wide-angle lens does. It has just studied 650 million images & captions, and left to draw its own conclusions. That's why there can't be a regular'manual' , based on functionality that the developers intentionally programmed in – even the creators of DALL·E cannot be sure what DALL·E has or hasn't 'learned' , or what it thinks different phrases mean.\n\nSometimes, less is more. Prompts can't be more than 400 characters, in any case. And you can get amazing results from just a few emojis! But if you have a specific outcome in mind, then being specific in your prompt will help. A simple adjective, like 'action photography' , already embodies a lot of characteristics (about shutter speed, framing, lens choices, etc) that you might otherwise define separately. There are 'fingers-crossed' prompt phrases, like AI-era prayers, hoped to mean 'make it really good!' , such as 4k, 8k, highquality, trending, award-winning, acclaimed, on artstation, etc. However, the precise impact of these has not been rigorously tested. But feel free to add them! In text AI models, simple prompt tweaks have created huge boosts in performance: for instance, when a text generator is made to answer a math puzzle, starting with the words 'Let's think things through step-by-step' makes it 4x more likely to get the right answer. So no doubt, there are similar DALL·E hacks yet to be found…\n\nYou can borrow some photographic prompt terminology (especially for framing) to apply to illustrations: e.g: 'close-up.' If you are generating mockups of 3D art, you can also define how that piece is photographed! Adjectives can easily influence multiple factors, e.g: 'art deco' will influence the illustration style, but also the clothing and materials of the subject, unless otherwise defined. Years, decades and eras, like '1924' or 'late-90s', can also have this effect. Even superficially specific prompts have more 'general' effects. For instance, defining a camera or lens ('Sigma 75mm') doesn't just 'create that specific look', it more broadly alludes to 'the kind of photo where the lens/camera appears in the description', which tend to be professional and hence higher-quality. If a style is proving elusive, try 'doubling down' with related terms (artists, years, media, movement) years, e.g: rather than simply '…by Picasso' , try '…Cubist painting by Pablo Picasso, 1934, colourful, geometric work of Cubism, in the style of \"Two Girls Reading.\" Or try unbundling!) \n\nDetailed prompts are great if you know exactly what you're looking for and are trying to get a specific effect. …but DALL·E also has a creative eye, and has studied over 400 million images. So there is nothing wrong with being vague, and seeing what happens! You can also use variations to create further riffs of your favourite output. Sometimes you'll end up on quite a journey! Putting together this document has been quite an undertaking, as it aims to cover all 16777216¹⁰⁴⁸⁵⁷⁶ possible DALL·E images (vs the 10⁸⁰ atoms in the universe) and all possible subjects of images, which is to say, all possible objects and materials in existence, depicted in all known methods. For 2D art, we've gone a little deeper, looking at particular art styles and art movements. But if you want to create images of buildings, for example, then learning more about architectural periods, famous architects, and names of architectural details will be helpful to create specific outputs. Same for candlesticks, cartoons or candy wrappers. DALL·E knows a lot about everything, so the deeper your knowledge of the requisite jargon, the more detailed the results. \n<Preview of prompting and Dall-E>\n\n<Instruction>\nFirst, you are gonna see a company analysis you should use that to choose a style. The styles you can choose are mainly ‘general vibes’, ‘photography’,’ illustration’,’art history’ and ‘3D artwork’. For example; if there is real stuff or a product you can choose 3D artwork, an object or a real state you can choose photography for two of those using cases you can use”'Photographing' your work”. If there are some fun things or technological you may decide on illustration. or for any subject, you may decide on general vibes. If you choose any style stay in that style for all promts. Examine all the phrases, words, categories and techniques I gave you down below. According to the company analysis that the user will give, choose the best style that will be suitable and edit the given prompts, modify it and make it better. Just give the prompt outputs that will go directly to the Dall-e.\n<your output format>\n[\n{\n\"promt\":”(insert your modified promt)\"\n},\n(write down each prompt until finishing all the given prompts. if you have an input you should have an output)\n]\n\n<your output format>\n<general vibes>\n<Emotional prompt words>\nPositive mood, low energy 😌 ; light, peaceful, calm, serene, soothing, relaxed, placid, comforting, cosy, tranquil, quiet, pastel, delicate, graceful, subtle, balmy, mild, ethereal, elegant, tender, soft, light.\nPositive mood, high energy 🤪 ;bright, vibrant, dynamic, spirited, vivid, lively, energetic, colorful, joyful, romantic, expressive, bright, rich, kaleidoscopic, psychedelic, saturated, ecstatic, brash, exciting, passionate, hot.\nNegative mood, low energy 😢; muted, bleak, funereal, somber, melancholic, mournful, gloomy, dismal, sad, pale, washed-out, desaturated, grey, subdued, dull, dreary, depressing, weary, tired.\nNegative mood, high energy 😱; dark, ominous, threatening, haunting, forbidding, gloomy, stormy, doom, apocalyptic, sinister, shadowy, ghostly, unnerving, harrowing, dreadful, frightful, shocking, terror, hideous, ghastly, terrifying.\n<Emotional prompt words>\n<Size-y, structure-y words>\nBig and free; Curvaceous, swirling, organic, riotous, turbulent, flowing, amorphous, natural, distorted, uneven, random, lush, organic, bold, intuitive, emotive, chaotic, tumultuous, earthy, churning.\nBig and structured; Monumental, imposing, rigorous, geometric, ordered, angular, artificial, lines, straight, rhythmic, composed, unified, manmade, perspective, minimalist, blocks, dignified, robust, defined.\nSmall and structured; Ornate, delicate, neat, precise, detailed, opulent, lavish, elegant, ornamented, fine, elaborate, accurate, intricate, meticulous, decorative, realistic.\nSmall and free; Unplanned, daring, brash, random, casual, sketched, playful, spontaneous, extemporaneous, offhand, improvisational, experimental, loose, jaunty, light, expressive.\n<Size-y, structure-y words>\n<Looks, vibes, -punks, -waves>\nVaporwave: neon, pink, blue, geometric, futuristic, '80s. \nPost-apocalyptic: grey, desolate, stormy, fire, decay\nGothic, fantasy: stone, dark, lush, nature, mist, mystery, angular\nCybernetic, sci-fi: glows, greens, metals, armor, chrome\nSteampunk: gold, copper, brass, Victoriana\nMemphis, Memphis Group, 1980s, bold, kitch, colourful, shapes\nDieselpunk, grimy, steel, oil, '50s, mechanised, punk cousin of steampnk\nAfrofuturism: futuristic, and African! \nCyberpunk, 1990s, dyed hair, spiky, graphic elements .\nBiopunk, organic: greens, slimes, plants, futuristic, weird \n<Looks, vibes, -punks, -waves>\n<general vibes>\n<photography>\nThinking about photography prompts\nHow is the photo composed? What is the emotional vibe of the image? How close are we to the subject? What angle? How much depth of field? How is the subject lit? Where from? How much light? Artificial or natural light? What colour? What time of day? What camera or lens? Macro, telephoto or wide angle? Where is it shot? in the studio or out in the world? What film or process is used? Digital or film? What year was it taken? In what context was this photo ultimately published or used?\nExample 1:A close-up(framing), black & white studio photographic portrait(film type) of SUBJECT, dramatic backlighting(lighting prompt), 1973 photo from Life Magazine(year & usage context)\nExample 2: A vibrant(vibe prompt) photograph of SUBJECT, wide shot(framing), outdoors(shoot context), sunset photo at golden hour(lighting prompt), wide-angle lens(lens & camera prompt), soft focus, shot on iPhone 6, on Flickr in 2007(year & usage context)\n<Camera angles: proximity>\nDALL·E interprets these pretty loosely, and often provides candidate from the 'neighbour' framing, e.g: a close-up prompt might get extreme close-ups and medium shots in the mix.\nExtreme close-up; Film still of a cackling man, bushy moustache, extreme close-up shot\nClose-up; A close-up of a woman’s face, captured in low light with a soft focus. There is a gentle pink hue to the image, and the woman’s features are lightly blurred.

You can also name non-existent media with genre + year prompts, e.g: 'from action-adventure film \"SHIVER ME TIMBERS!\"(1973) Note: this prompt will also influence the background, costumes, hairstyles, and any other uncontrolled factors!\nA man in a Grim Reaper costume, from…TV show Friends, Season 3 (1997), TV show Starsky & Hutch (1975)\nKermit the Frog, from…The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014),Blade Runner 2049 (2017)\nA tall Black woman, drinking red wine, from…TV series Frasier (1994), 'Breaking Bad', Season 4 (2011)\nA pile of books on a bedside table, from…Netflix show, Stranger Things (2016),Citizen Kane (1941)\nTwo construction workers arguing intently, from…Jaws (1975),Amelie (2001)\n<Prompt hack: film & TV prompts, 'Film still of… '>\n<Photo genres and usage contexts >\nYou can sometimes get a coherent look just by specifying the context: is this photo from a fashion magazine, a hard-hitting exposé in a newspaper, or a wedding photographer's portfolio?\naction sports photography, fast shutter speed from ESPN \neditorial fashion photography, from Vogue magazine\ncandid street portrait, photojournalism from The New York Times\nprofessional corporate portrait, from investor prospectus\n flash photography, event photography, film premier photograph from celebrity news website \n<Photo genres and usage contexts >\n<Portrait photographer prompts, select tests> \n“Photo of a young Mexican woman in the style of…”\nGeorge Hurrell\n Martin Schoeller\n Dorothea Lange\n Lee Jeffries\n Terry Richardson\n<Portrait photographer prompts, select tests>  \nSidebar: is prompting for living artists, like… OK? Artists need to make a living. After all, it's only through the creation of human art to date DALL·E has anything to be trained on! So what becomes of an artist, once civilians like you and I can just conjure up art 'in the style of [artist]'? Van Gogh's ghost can surely cope with such indignities – but living artists might feel differently about having their unique style automagically cloned. Of course, DALL·E's policies disallow uploading images that you don't own the rights for. (Although unlike naughty words in prompts, Open AI really has no way of checking.) But once an artist reaches a certain level of renown, and DALL·E has countered their art in the wild, it's possible for users to deploy the artist's style simply by prompting for it in text, at least in theory. (In practice, DALL·E 2 is currently quite hit and miss at mimicking particular artists, but in a year or two? Maybe not.) The debate around doing so is not without substance, although we should also remember that successful artists have always attracted loving imitators (and cynical impersonators) long prior to the advent of artificial intelligence. Legally, although an artist's 'style' cannot be subject to copyright, derivative works of specific artworks could possibly construed as infringing. (They arguably aren't infringing - but then again, you might not be able to afford to defend yourself.) Assessing whether an artwork in the public domain is complicated - this guide from Cornell University may be helpful.\n\nClockwise from top left: 1) an original artwork by Simon Stålenhag 2) right, a DALL·E generation for the prompt: Monumental old ruins tower of a dark misty forest, overcast, sci-fi digital painting by Simon Stålenhag 3) below, digital artworks by human artists 'inspired by' Stålenhag, on Behance\n\nA few final photography ideas 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Don't forget, you can still edit your images in familiar tools like Photoshop, Lightroom, Snapseed and Instagram. So when it comes to colour grading or vintage effects, it might be easier to use these! If your output has a human face in, you won't be able to re-upload the file later to inpaint/outpaint/uncrop - but you can edit it now, directly in DALL·E. (This doesn't apply to illustrations!) DALL·E also knows about a lot of photographers, directors, movies - more than could possibly be documented here. But expect to see more examples in Version 2 of this document, coming soon! Try TenCent's free face restorer AI to make minor facial tweaks. Note, it will only remove small artefacts and blurred details, not change the geometry of a face altogether (it assumes the input is a real photograph that's been damaged) Are you sure you want a photo? Ask yourself if this is something that could realistically be photographed: e.g, it's easy to draw 'a mouse and elephant that are friends' , but because they are such different sizes in reality, it's very difficult to create a plausible photo that brings it to life.
